This diagnostic puts up a fairly complex grid composed of
lines drawn with DLV and DGB instructions.  If it is working
properly it should look like a checkerboard with a single large
X over it.  Every other vertical or horizontal line should be
dim (as it is drawn in suppressed grid).

The program is auto-starting, and it will return to SSV if
control-Z is typed.
