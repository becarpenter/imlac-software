IMLAC PAPER TAPE READ PROGRAM.

THIS IS A LITTLE HACK TO READ 8-BIT PAPER TAPES IN THE
IMLAC PAPER TAPE BLOCK LOAD FORMAT, ON THE PDP-10 PTR UNDER I.T.S.

(1) SETUP PAPER TAPE IN THE READER ON THE PDP-10, BEING
    SURE TO SKIP OVER THE PTR BLOCK LOADER ON THE TAPE.
    (THIS IS USUALLY THE FIRST BLOCK OF STUFF ON THE TAPE
    SEPARATED FROM THE REST BY A BATCH OF BLANK TAPE.)

(2) TYPE AT DDT :IMLAC;IMPTR
    OR :ARC:IMLAC;IMPTR IF IMPTR IS ARCHIVED. THE TAPE
    WILL BE READ AND THE PROGRAM WILL STOP BY EXITING
     TO DDT WITH A MESSAGE, "ALL DONE".  NOW THE CONTENTS OF
     THE TAPE WILL EXIST IN A FILE IMLAC;IMTAPE >.  COPY OR
     RENAME THIS FILE IMMEDIATELY.

(3) TO READ ANOTHER TAPE, JUST ALT-P OR ALT-G THE PROGRAM.

THE FORMAT OF THE FILE IS CORE IMAGE BINARY (16-BIT WORDS IN
EACH 36-BIT PDP-10 WORD).  TO PUT THIS IN A FORM LOADABLE BY
IMLOAD, DO (IN DDT) J$J  THEN 100$0L IMLAC;IMTAPE > (OR WHATEVER
FILE NAME YOU ARE USING) AND THEN DO 100$Y ^XBIN  AND YOU WILL
GET IMTAPE BIN (OR WHATEVER) WHICH CAN BE IMTRAN'ED AND THEN
IMLOADED.  (IMLOADING DIRECTLY RUNS THE RISK OF NOT ZEROING OUT
BLOCKS OF ZEROS.  THIS BUG SHOULD BE FIXED)
