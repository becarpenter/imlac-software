		  LVHTEST (Long-Vector Hardware Test Program)

   LVHTEST is designed as a test program capable of determining the limiting
   number of inches of long-vector display that can be processed by the PDS-
   1 Display Processor before the processor has exceeded e 'reasonable' time
   limit.

   This is done by drawing a test pattern on the screen, and increasing  the
   number  of inches drawn until the display time is in excess of a fortieth
   of a second.  The test pattern is a set of points lieing on a circle with
   long-vectors drawn between all pairs of points.

   The user may arrive at the maximum drawing capability in one of two ways.
   He may input parameters manually until a limiting combination is reached,
   or he may start the program at a  set of values and put the program  into
   its  automatic mode.   The program then draws the pattern and continually
   enlarges the display  until the  limit is reached.   When  this limit  is
   reached  using either method, manual or  automatic, a dot is displayed in
   the center of the screen.

   The general format for the input of parameters is

			 POINTS, RADIUS, LEVEL, COPIES


   Where:

   POINTS 

   The number of points  around the circle to  be generated is specified  in
   the first parameter of the general input statement.  It is specified by a
   number  from  one to  zero.   These numbers  correspond to  prime numbers
   internally held.  That number will be displayed.

   The default value for the number of points is 37 (represented by the  key
   zero).


   RADIUS

   The  radius of  the circle  to be  generated is  specified by  inputing a
   number between 100 and 511.  This number is the number of rastor units in
   the circle.  The program default is 511.


   LEVEL

   The level parameter indicates  #the level of  connectors to be  generated
   between  the points.   For example:  Level 1  indicates that all adjacent
   points on the circle will be  connected.   Level 2 indicates that all  of
   the  adjacent points  on the  circle will  be connected,  and every other
   point   will  be  connected.    Level  3   indicates  that  all  adjacent
   points,every other point, and every third point around the circle will be
   connected.

   Level is specified  by a  number from 1  to (Points  - 1).   The  program
   default is (Points - 1)/2.


   COPIES

   The parameter, Copies, indicates the number of times that a display to be
   generated  will  be drawn.   It  is  specified by  a  number from  one to
   ten(i.e.,1-0).   The default value is one.


   NOTES ON INPUT OF PARAMETERS 

   Between each input of a parameter,  a comma must be given.   If not,  the
   key will be read as if it were part of the parameter.  In the case of the
   Points and the Copies parameters, the values displayed will be changed as
   will the values stored.  This means that if a mistake is made in inputing
   either  of these parameters it  can be corrected by  simply typing in the
   intended value.

   In the case of the Radius and Level parameters, however, it is not  quite
   the  same.   These  parameters  will  accept up  to  3  and  2 characters
   respectively.   So, if for example, the user has input the number '2'  as
   an  entry for the Level parameter, but he intended to use the number '12'
   he would have to first fill the existing 'accept' capacity (2  characters
   in  the Level  parameter).   He would  do this  by typing  some arbitrary
   character.   This would fill  the two  character accept  capacity of  the
   parameter.   The  next character he input  would clear the existing value
   and display and  would begin  freshly.   In the example,  the user  would
   (after  typing the arbitrary character) input the number '12' which would
   become the new value of Level.

   The user may also elect to use the program default value.   This is  done
   by  simply  inputing  a comma,  or  in  the case  of  the  last parameter
   (Copies), a carraige return, without inputing any value of his  own.   In
   addition,  the user may  at any time  in the course  of inputing the four
   parameters type a carraige return.  This has the effect of defaulting all
   values not  yet specified,  while leaving  intact all  values which  have
   been.



   SPECIAL FUNCTION KEYS


   CTRL-Z used to exit the program.

   ESC  resets the program and therefore allows the user to form another DLV
   list with different parameters.

   PAGE XMIT changes the  display from the initial  input display where  the
   calculated display length is shown to the display of the test pattern and
   visa versa.  

   CTRL B shifts from large to small display buffer, or visa versa.  A large
   buffer is default.   A small buffer does protects the upper 2k from being
   modified.	A large buffer  allows the user to  draw some of the  larger
   test  patterns.   If the user attempts to  draw these with a small buffer
   the program resets itself.

   A is the key which invokes  the automatic mode.   When the key is  typed,
   the  existing values  of POINTS and  COPIES are retained,  the others are
   handled by the  program.   LEVELS is  defaulted while  RADIUS is  changed
   until  the maximum  display is  reached.   At this  point the  display is
   returned to the input mode, and the radius is displayed under the  column
   of  calculated values of  display inches.   The generated  display can be
   invoked with the PAGE XMIT key, as usual.   Only issue the A key before a
   display  is  built  (before an  asteric  appears in  upper  right corner)
   otherwise the program will fail.
